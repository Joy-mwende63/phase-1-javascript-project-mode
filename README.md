# Book Management Application

## Overview

My Book Library is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their book collection. Users can view, borrow, return, and delete books while also tracking borrowing history and statistics. This application interacts with a backend service to manage book data and provides a user-friendly interface for book management.

## Features

- **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Users can borrow books by entering their name, and return books they have borrowed.
- **Statistics**: Displays overall borrowing statistics and the most popular books based on borrowing count.
- **Delete Books**: Allows users to remove books from the list.

## Technologies Used
